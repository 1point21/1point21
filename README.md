- 👋 Hi, I’m @1point21

- 👀 I’m currently learning to be a Junior Cloud / DevOps engineer at Northcoders in Manchester, breaking into the technology sector from previous roles in education and law.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, AWS, Terraform, Docker and Kubernetes. Also getting exposure to agile methodologies and different programming approaches. I have just finished my first portfolio piece, a fully scalable and resilient microservices architecture, written in Terraform and deployable in AWS - check it out on my profile!
   
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on a project which would allow me to use and develop the skills I have learned so far.
  
- 📫 How to reach me - check out my LinkedIn for more information about me, my skills and my previous experience: https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-drinkall/
